# Cooking lunch instruction
As I consider myself a huge fan of italian cuisine, I decided to pick one of the most iconic italian dishes for lunch - lasagna. In case you never heard about such dish, here's wikipedia definition for you:
>Lasagne, or the singular lasagna, is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese (which may include ricotta and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagne casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.

So, first things first, we need to gather up all the ingridients:
| INGRIDIENT | QUANTITY |
| ------ | ------ |
| minced meat | 800-900 grams |
| tomato juice (or tomato sauce) | 1 glass |
| olive oil | 3 tablespoons |
| minced onion | 1/2 cup |
| garlic | 3-4 cloves |
| mozzarella cheese | 300 grams |
| parmesan cheese | 100 grams |
| lasagna sheets | 15-16 pcs |
| milk | 0.8-1 liter |
| butter | 80-100 grams |
| flour | 80-100 grams |
| ground nutmeg | 1/4 teaspoons |
| salt and pepper | to taste |
| fresh basil (for serving, optional) | 3 sprigs |

After we have all we need, let's get cooking.
- Prepare the bechamel sauce.

To do this, melt butter and add flour, fry everything together for 3 minutes. The base of the sauce is ready and now you can proceed to the next step. Pour in all the milk in a thin stream with constant stirring to eliminate the appearance of lumps. Brew the sauce, stirring constantly over medium heat with a whisk until it thickens to a thin cream. Add a few pinches of salt to taste and grated or ground nutmeg. The bechamel sauce is ready. Set it aside until you assemble the lasagna.
- Prepare the bolognese sauce.

Cut the onion and garlic into small cubes. Simmer in a frying pan until soft with olive oil. Then add the minced meat and, with constant stirring with a wooden spatula, break it into small pieces. It should be well browned. Pour in tomato juice or use tomato sauce and simmer for another 5-10 minutes until the sauce is half evaporated. Add some salt and pepper to taste.
- Assemble the lasagna

Take a rectangular ceramic baking dish. Brush it with butter. Spread a small amount of bechamel sauce all over the bottom of the dish. Arrange the lasagna sheets so that they cover the bottom of the dish as much as possible. It's okay if you have to put them with a little overlap. Spread a third of the bolognese sauce evenly over the lasagna sheets using a spoon or spatula. Now add a little bechamel sauce. Try to distribute it evenly around the entire perimeter. Sprinkle with a mix of parmesan and mozzarella so that the cheese is evenly distributed over the dish. Cover with lasagna sheets and repeat the assembly procedure 2-3, maybe even 4 times depending on the height of the dish.
- Bake in the oven

Send the baking dish to the oven at 180 degrees for 40-50 minutes until a delicious golden brown crust appears. Cut the hot lasagna into portions and serve with basil leaves. Bon Appetit!
